My i3 config
===

# Introduction

This is my i3 configuration, it has grown in size and complexity over the years.

This repo is just an occational release when i feel like it. The original is
managed in a private repo.

This repo consists of a number of scripts that eventually generate configs for
the following programs:
 - i3 (example in config_generated_example)
 - rofi
 - i3blocks

# Dependencies

I dont really keep track of these, but the following ones at least are pretty
important for this setup:

 - dmenu
 - rofi
 - i3blocks

The following are also used but arent that important:

 - Compton
 - PulseAudio
 - i3lock
 - scrot

NOTE: this list is not exhaustive as there are many programs that i have
included shortcuts

# How to use
1. Clone the repo into .config
2. Copy the file in the "example" folder to .config/i3 (without .example in the
   name)
3. Edit them to use your desired settings
4. run switchconfig.sh (requires "baseconfigs" to be configured)

# Things that probably wont work

 - Backgrounds - i store these outside the repo but set them in the config
 - some scripts that use credentials from outside the repo

# Explaination of the files and directories
